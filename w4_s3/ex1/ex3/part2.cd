Q1. You need to keep an integer variable _currentIndex in the _ImageGalleryState class. 
        This variable keeps track of the index of the currently displayed image in the list.

Q2. The Scaffold is already wrapped within the StatefulWidget (ImageGallery)
        so you can manage state updates when navigating between images.
